## Christian Hirschey

Hi! I am Christian Hirschey, a National Merit Scholar and a 5-year Computer Science and Mathematics Statistics/MBA student at The University of Alabama interested in software engineering and data science. I am involved in the EPIC Scholars Program on campus, pursuing a minor in Engineering Positive and Intentional Change. This program has enhanced my understanding of how to apply engineering skills and concepts in an ethical and socially conscious manner.

Outside of my studies and programming, I am an ACT, Mathematics, and History tutor hoping to equip the next generation with the skills they need to thrive in higher education. Throughout my tutoring, I've managed to maintain a 100% customer satisfaction rate operating in various environments, including one-on-one sessions and large group classes ranging from 2-8 students.

In my free time, I am passionate about fitness and self-improvement, love to code, and enjoy playing the drums, whether for a rock band, a jazz band, or even a bagpipe band.

My top skills include C++, Python (Pandas, Tensorflow), React, JavaScript, HTML/CSS, Java, and SQL.

If you have any questions or would like to get in contact with me, feel free to message me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/christianhirschey/) or email me at cjhirschey@crimson.ua.edu.
